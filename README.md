# Sales-Summary-from-a-Tiny-SQLite-Database-using-Python
# ðŸ“Š Sales Summary Project

This project connects to a small SQLite database (`sales_data.db`) and summarizes sales data using Python.

### What I Did:
- Created a SQLite database with a simple sales table
- Wrote SQL queries to calculate total quantity sold and total revenue per product
- Used pandas to load and display the data
- Visualized the revenue using a basic bar chart in matplotlib

The final output includes printed results and a bar chart showing revenue by product.

Tools: Python, SQLite, Pandas, Matplotlib
